Chartered in 1831 by the New York State Legislature,[13] NYU was founded by a group of New Yorkers led by then Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin. In 1832, the initial non-denominational all-male institution began its first classes near City Hall based on a curriculum focused on a secular education. The university later moved and has maintained its main campus in Greenwich Village surrounding Washington Square Park, but was forced to sell its University Heights campus in the Bronx in 1973. Since then, the university has added a division in Brooklyn's MetroTech Center and graduate schools throughout Manhattan. NYU has become the largest private university in the United States by enrollment, with a total of 51,848 enrolled students, including 26,733 undergraduate students and 25,115 graduate students, in 2019. NYU also receives the most applications of any private institution in the United States and admissions is considered highly selective. (Wikipedia)"
